Title: Zen: A scalable, easy-to-use python library for network analysis

Abstract:
It is now commonplace for network datasets to consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of nodes and edges.  Despite the availability of such massive datasets, many established tools for network analysis are unable to gracefully handle them. Often this is because these systems have not been built to accommodate datasets of this scale.  The Zen network library has been implemented specifically to permit the analysis of massive network datasets without sacrificing ease and speed of use in the research setting.  Most algorithms and routines in the library are implemented entirely in highly optimized C, yielding performance that rivals the fastest existing tools.  Furthermore, it introduces new network storage formats that dramatically decrease loading times for large networks.  Throughout, the library adheres to the conventions of pythonic design, making it easy to use in addition to fast.  For this reason, it is a tool that is well suited to the network scientist's toolbox.  In this poster, we introduce the core features of the library, provide benchmarks comparing its performance to other network tools, and highlight its unique capabilities that make network analysis and algorithmic prototyping easy and fast.

Introductory Tutorials
======================

The following tutorials are designed to introduce you to some of the most important features that will make Zen immediately useful to you.  They assume that you know what a graph/network is as well as some fundamental notions in graph theory like shortest paths and centrality.  If these sound foreign to you, still give the tutorials a try as key ideas will be linked to relevant Wikipedia pages that may give the introduction you need.  If you still feel shaky, consider picking up an `introductory book on network analysis <http://www.amazon.com/Networks-An-Introduction-Mark-Newman/dp/0199206651/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1333996998&sr=1-4>`_.

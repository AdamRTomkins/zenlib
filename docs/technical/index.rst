Welcome to Zen's technical documentation.  This documentation consists of three main parts.

 	* The :doc:`API Reference <api/api>` for all classes, methods, and functions in the Zen library.
	* A :doc:`collection of tutorials <tutorials/tutorials_top>` that range from introductory to advanced.  These cover a wide array of topics from creating your first graph to extending Zen with your own high-performance graph algorithms.
	* The :doc:`Developer Guide <dev/index>` providing a detailed discussion of the design patterns and principles used throughout the Zen library.  If you're looking to contribute to the Zen library or build your own extensions, this will be a useful resource.
